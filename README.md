# 🌿 Smart Irrigation System - AICTE Internship (Week 1)

This repository contains the **Week 1 work** of the *Smart Irrigation* project under the **AICTE Shell India - Edunet Foundation Internship Program**.

---

## 📌 Project Title
**Smart Irrigation using Artificial Intelligence**

---

## 🧠 Objective
To develop a machine learning model that can predict irrigation requirements for multiple crop parcels based on real-time sensor data.

---

## 🏗️ Week 1 Work Summary
- Loaded and explored the dataset of sensor values.
- Preprocessed the data (scaling using MinMaxScaler).
- Trained a **Random Forest Classifier** using `MultiOutputClassifier` to handle multiple target outputs (`parcel_0`, `parcel_1`, `parcel_2`).
- Evaluated the model using classification metrics.
- Saved the cleaned dataset and working Jupyter Notebook.
